Git is a lightweight, distributed source control system.
Big difference from traditional client/server models of source control.

How do we mean distributed?

You have a full repo. Cue shitty on a plane scenario.
You can then push/pull this repo, or indiv branches to other users.

Commit as much as you like locally - no server pressure
But, back up your machine.

Allows for more varied workflows. Smaller groups. Can scale. Used for Linux kernel (1000s of committers)
